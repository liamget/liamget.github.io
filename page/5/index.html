<blockquote>
<p>In 2017, Ayelet Waldman and Michael Chabon published a book of stories and essays about Israel and Palestine, marking what they refer to as the 50th anniversary of the occupation of the West Bank.</p>
<p>For the book, Kingdom of Olives and Ash, they invited some of the best writers in the world to visit the countries and document the human stories happening away from the headlines.</p>
<p>For Pulitzer-prize winner Geraldine Brooks, this marked a return to the region, having worked for years as a Middle East correspondent for the Wall Street Journal in the 1980s and 90s.</p>
<p>In the Drawing Room, Brooks and Liam Getreu from the New Israel Fund Australia Foundation spoke about the collection and about the conflict.</p>

                    Australian Jewish News: Time to end the occupation

                <p><p><a href="https://www.australianjewishnews.com/time-end-occupation/">The Australian Jewish News</a> published my op-ed marking fifty years of Israel&rsquo;s occupation of the Palestinian territories.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fifty years ago, Israel braced itself for war. Egypt, Jordan and Syria surrounded the country and proclaimed Israel’s imminent destruction. But Israel struck first, delivering a fatal blow to Egypt’s air force within hours of the war beginning.</p>
<p>The Arab armies, already humiliated by their defeat in the war for Israel’s independence in 1948, tasted the same again in the 1967 Six-Day War. At that time Israel’s borders were thought of by many as “Auschwitz borders” – that they were indefensible and would lead to another slaughter of Jews. They were wrong.</p>
<p>In Israel, the joy that followed the victory was universal. Jewish communities around the world were ecstatic and proud of Israel’s astonishing military success. It meant breathing room. For the first time – perhaps literally – Israel was truly on the map.</p>
<p>With victory came reunion with sites of significance that Jews had longed for over 2000 years in exile. The Western Wall in Jerusalem. Hebron’s Cave of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs. For religious and secular Jews alike, these sites meant everything.</p>
<p>Of course, there was another side to the story. It soon sank in that with the renewal of Jewish bonds with these ancient sites came some one million Palestinian residents.</p>
<p>There were Palestinians who had lived there for generations or joined them during the 1948 war; there were others who were pushed out or fled Jewish advances, or were manipulated into leaving by Arab leaders abroad.</p>
<p>It’s not that Israel’s leaders didn’t understand this. They knew the choices – absorb the territories and grant citizenship to a million non-Jews, or withdraw in exchange for peace. As Israeli historian Gershom Gorenberg wrote: the Israeli government “decided not to decide”. Instead it began what has now become a messianically driven 50-year national project of settlement in the conquered lands.</p>
<p>Over the years, Israeli governments of the left and right incentivised half a million Jews to settle on land it never claimed as their own. Israel remains only a temporary custodian of the land. But nothing temporary should last half a century.</p>
<p>Many Israelis understand – including the father of the settlements, the late prime minister Ariel Sharon, and Israel’s High Court of Justice – that Israel governs the West Bank in an increasingly belligerent military occupation.</p>
<p>Since 1967 Israel has placed Palestinians under harsh rule that doesn’t befit a thriving, albeit imperfect, democracy.</p>
<p>Palestinians in the Occupied Territories lack the same human rights afforded citizens of Israel, including freedom of association, speech and movement. Their lives are ultimately controlled by Israel, and yet they have no say in that government. Settlers, who live often just across the road, have full rights.</p>
<p>Terror and violence against Israelis have, understandably, hardened their hearts. Yet the reality recognised by the country’s most venerated former military, security and intelligence officials is different.</p>
<p>Virtually all of them say that Israel will be more secure behind internationally recognised borders. Earlier this year, a former Mossad chief labelled the occupation Israel’s only existential threat. The West Bank isn’t a security asset, it’s a liability.</p>
<p>Peace efforts over the decades have been squandered by both sides. Meetings in Oslo, Camp David and Annapolis ended with the Palestinian leadership walking away. The Arab Peace Initiative of 2002 has never been formally responded to by Israel, and plans for a regional deal advanced by Egypt and Jordan last year were rejected by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
<p>Peace processes have alternately inspired and depressed both Israelis and Palestinians and their supporters around the world. But nothing has changed: Israel doesn’t have security; Palestinians don’t have a state.</p>
<p>The time has now come – 50 years since the Six-Day War and 70 years since the UN’s plan to create Jewish and Palestinian states – to realise the dream of a secure and independent Israel next to a secure and independent Palestine.</p>
<p>The alternative – endless violence and conflict – is unacceptable for everyone. Palestinians will not give up until they have their own state. Israelis will not rest until theirs is secure.</p>
<p>The only way forward, as Amos Oz writes, is a fair divorce. After the unhappy reality of 50 years of occupation, it is too much to dream of a happy marriage; only of an amicable separation.</p>
<p>Conflicts no less contentious – Ireland, the Balkans, even Europe after two of the bloodiest wars in human history – have managed an amicable separation. Why not Israel and Palestine?</p>
<p>In the absence of leaders with the courage needed to make tough decisions, we owe it to Israelis and Palestinians not to turn our backs but, instead, to say, after 50 years of occupation, we will not let it continue.</p>

                <p><p><a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-12-15/getreu-newt-gingrich-should-reconsider-his-approach-to-israel/3732940">My op-ed on the Republican primaries was published in ABC&rsquo;s The Drum:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The jostle for the Republican nomination to challenge US President Barack Obama, when it comes to Israel, is quickly becoming a race to the bottom.</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s not surprising that with the virulent &ldquo;Obama hates Israel&rdquo; campaign in recent years these candidates would move to the right, it may well be they&rsquo;re reaching new lows.</p>
<p>It seems that with each new day comes another interview or debate in which the front-runners - Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich - and those on the periphery - Michele Bachmann, Rick Perry and others - try to outdo each other on Israel. They&rsquo;re clambering for support from the hawkish Jewish Right, trying to prove that they, more than any other, are the true &lsquo;pro-Israel&rsquo; candidate. The only thing is, in doing so, they&rsquo;re ultimately being destructive to Israel&rsquo;s own interests.</p>
<p>For example, since the Six-Day War, US foreign policy has held that Israeli settlements over the Green line are illegal, putting its interpretation of the Geneva Convention in line with everyone else&rsquo;s. That policy has formed the basis of American support of the two-state solution to this day - that the West Bank and Gaza are temporarily occupied by Israel in the expectation that one day soon they will disengage, with minimal agreed swaps, to create a Palestinian state.</p>
<p>While one would hope it unnecessary to expand on, sadly today it seems as though it is. Realising a two-state solution, that is, Israel and Palestine living next to each other, is the only way to sustain the Zionist dream of a Jewish and democratic state. Without it, Israel will either have to give up its Jewish or democratic character, neither of which is something I would like to see.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not good enough for these Republicans, though. They all seem to prefer pandering to a base of support in Jewish America that is so extreme it in fact does reject the idea of a future Palestinian state. Last week on CNN, Texas Governor Rick Perry did just that:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I consider the Israeli settlements to be legal, from my perspective, and I support them,&rdquo; he said, despite being reminded by host Wolf Blitzer the hitherto bi-partisan condemnation of the settlements.</p>
<p>Michele Bachmann has been showing her commitment to Israel too, holding up her time spent on a kibbutz in Israel as proof of pro-Israel-ness. That brought the Daily Show&rsquo;s Jon Stewart to quip that she &ldquo;loves Israel so much she was willing to join a socialist collective,&rdquo; perhaps not the press she was looking for. That&rsquo;s not the worst of it, though.</p>
<p>No, that prize belongs to former speaker of the house Newt Gingrich who, in an interview with &lsquo;The Jewish Channel&rsquo; espoused an ideology usually reserved for the political fringes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Palestinians are an invented people,&rdquo; newly crowned frontrunner Gingrich said. While it&rsquo;s probably fair to say that the Palestinians are a new people, more so than the Jews, for example, to say they&rsquo;re invented is applying an arbitrary system of determining identity that neither Gingrich nor anyone else seem keen to apply to anyone else. In fact, by that standard they&rsquo;re barely newer than the Australian national identity, perhaps making our own cultural independence equally worthless.</p>
<p>Who cares where or when or how the Palestinian national identity came to be? Over the years, as Jewish immigration intensified in the 1920s and around the time of the Holocaust, as 750,000 Arabs living in Palestine were expelled and/or fled as a result of the end of the British Mandate and the establishment of Israel, and then with the conquering of Arab lands by Israel in 1967, a unique identity was formed by Palestinians living in the Levant. That reality is crystal clear.</p>
<p>Perhaps the only thing clearer is that today the Palestinians have a well-defined desire for statehood, not only independent of the Israeli occupation, but also of their neighbouring Arab states. Virtually every country, and certainly all the serious players, including Israel, the Arab League, and the United States and the Quarter recognises this. But not Newt Gingrich.</p>
<p>His comments are the very definition of a counter-productive contribution to the peace process. How can the world be expected to tolerate an American administration led by a man who is not only hostile to its preferred endgame of shared sovereignty over the land, but even the very existence of one of the peoples hoping to share it? There is no hope their position of an honest broker can be sustained by a president with such a view.</p>
<p>Further, as someone who believes in the goal of continued Jewish self-determination in the form of the state of Israel, does calling into question one group&rsquo;s identity and desire for independence not also call into question my own? I am unwilling to tolerate anything of the sort; a future peace depends on recognising the here-and-now, accepting the legitimacy of claims and moving forward in good faith to broker a permanent, peaceful solution.</p>
<p>My message to Perry, Bachmann, Gingrich and others is simple - whoever is in your ear saying this is in Israel&rsquo;s interests, that this is what Jews want to hear when they talk about &lsquo;support for Israel&rsquo; is wrong. Support for Israel means honest and thoughtful support for both Israel&rsquo;s Jewish and democratic nature, and a commitment to the peace process. Marginalising Israel&rsquo;s partners in peace is the furthest thing from that.</p>
